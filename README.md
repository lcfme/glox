# glox

*glox* is a [Go](http://golang.org) implementation of the Lox programming language which is a demo language from the [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) book by [Bob Nystrom](https://github.com/munificent).

This is a work in progress and currently is a straight port as I read the book (upto the end of Chapter 5. Representing Code). My plan is to make this as idiomatic as I can as I progress with the project.
