# glox

*glox* is a [Go](http://golang.org) implementation of the Lox programming language which is a demo language from the [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) book by [Bob Nystrom](https://github.com/munificent).

This is a work in progress and currently is a straight port as I read the book (upto the end of Chapter 4. Scanning). What this means is that this code is more of a Java implementation in the language of Go, using Go constructs where necessary. My plan is to make this more idomatic Go as I progress with the projectâ€”so right now this currently is a working parser as per the approach outlined in Bob's wonderful prose.
